![Auto Complete Box](../Media/Controls\AutoCompleteBox\AutoCompleteBox.png)

The RadAutoCompleteBox control for Windows Runtime JavaScript applications is similar to the search box on Google and Bing in that it offers 
				suggestions as you type. It is designed to work in Windows Store applications using JavaScript. Below is an example of the RadAutoCompleteBox 
        in a real life scenario.

# Architecture

An autocomplete control, in general, is used to display a list of suggestions matching the text typed in a textbox.
					The list is displayed below this box.
				

The control can be bound to a static or live datasource and will request data automatically when the application user starts
					typing. The control may support templates for its items, so you can add images and other elements in addition to plain text.
				

# RadAutoCompleteBox

RadAutoCompleteBox shows a textbox, and once text is entered in the textbox, it displays a dropdown list with items. The box can
					also auto-complete the entered text.
				

The control offers a number of [configuration options](4aeec536-b3dd-4faa-b110-683bec99a6ac) - timed
					delay or number of characters entered before showing results, filter to apply to search data, separator and support for
					selecting more than one item.
				

RadAutoCompleteBox has rich [template support](4ec8c8ed-ab94-4839-bfce-7d544e07bf1a) - you can fully customize the layout of its items for better visualization of the
					provided options.
