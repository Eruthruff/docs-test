RadCalendar features keyboard navigation through all its views (month, year, decade, century) and building elements (header, footer, content). This article
				describes the available options for navigating the control via keyboard.
			

# Section1Keyboard navigation

Below you can find a list of the recognized keys by the built-in keyboard support logic of the RadCalendar control:

* 

Focus the control: __TAB__ key when RadCalendar is next in the tab order.
						

When the control is focused, the first element to get focused is the *Prev* button in the header. By pressing
							__TAB__ key, the user can then navigate through:
						

* 

Prev button in the header.

* 

Fast navigation button.

* 

Next button in the header.

* 

The first day from the current month.

* 

The *Today* link button in the footer.

* 

Focus same day from the previous week: __up arrow__.

* 

Navigate one view down (e.g. from year to month): __Ctrl + down arrow__.
