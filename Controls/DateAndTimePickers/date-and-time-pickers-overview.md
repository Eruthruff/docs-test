The RadDatePicker and RadTimePicker components for Windows 8 provide a fast and easy way
        for selecting dates and times respectively in a Windows Store JavaScript application. Below is an example 
        of the RadDatePicker used in a classic scenario.

# Architecture

Both components expose three elements for selecting values
          - day, month, year; and hour, minute, period - allow the user
          to choose dates or times by simply scrolling the looping lists beneath those three elements.
          The innovative user experience allows for infinite looping of all three date/time components.
        

Furthermore, you can fine-tune the behavior of the controls and make them fit your appâ€™s specific needs. 
          You can change the format of the displayed date/time or how the date/time elements 
          are arranged according to your preferences.
