![Drop Down List](../Media/Controls\DropDownList\DropDownList.png)

The RadDropDownList for Windows 8 is an HTML/JavaScript component that is similar to the HTML select element, but offers many advanced 
        features and customizations. It is designed to work with Windows Store applications and JavaScript. Below is an example of the 
        RadDropDownList in a real life scenario.

# Architecture

A dropdown control is used to display a list of items and select one of them. Only the selected item is displayed when the list is closed.

The control can be bound to a static or live datasource and will request data automatically when the dropdown is opened. The control
					supports templates for its items, so you can add images and other elements in addition to plain text.
				

# RadDropDownList

RadDropDownList shows a readonly textbox and a dropdown list with items once the down arrow on the control is clicked. There is no posibility to enter custom text in the dropdown - for that you should use RadComboBox.

RadDropDownList offers a number of configuration options - filtering data from the datasource, animations, rich client API with events and methods for controlling the dropdown.
