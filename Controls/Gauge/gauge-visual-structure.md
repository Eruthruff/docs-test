Description

[Scale](d8673fb8-360a-4951-b31c-e5ecbe525e7f)

The scale is used to visualize the range of values reachable by the gauge. In RadLinearGauge, it is a straight line, while in RadRadialGauge
							  it is a fraction of a (or a whole) circle. 
						  

Major Ticks

Lines crossing the scale that mark the major units on the scale. Major units are intervals between major divisions of the scale.
						  

Minor Ticks

Shorter lines crossing the scale that mark the minor units on the scale. Minor units are intervals between minor divisions of the scale.
						  

Labels

Placed next to each major tick, used to display the value it corresponds to.
						  

Ranges

Highlighted parts of the scale that usually mark a specific set of values that have a certain importance. For example, RPM range that is unsafe.
						  

Pointer

The pointer is a shape that points to the current value of the gauge. In RadLinearGauge this is a bar or an arrow drawn next to the scale. 
							  In RadRadialGauge it is an actual pointer.
