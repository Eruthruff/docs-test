# Architecture

A numeric textbox can display a number as currency, percent or differently formatted string. The visual content is defined depending on the specified format.
					The control could render spin buttons that help you increment/decrement the value with a predefined step.
					The value that the user can enter can be limited to a specific range.
					A numeric textbox component accepts only numeric entries.
				

# RadNumericBox

RadNumericBox fully implements the above-described architecture. Its behavior is easily controlled by a set of options. Furthermore, the control offers
					UX specifically designed for touch environments.
