__RadPagination__ supports layout customizations through CSS. The default rendering aligns
        all comprising parts of the control in a grid (4 columns x 1 row). The following article will show how developers can 
        reposition the parts of the pagination to build customized layouts using the CSS grid layout properties.
      

# Section1

Changing the Pagination layout involves redefining the CSS grid applied to __.t-pagination__
          and repositioning the Pagination parts (__.t-prev__, __.t-next__,
          __.t-thumbnails__, __.t-label__) along the new grid. Here's the
          grid layout CSS for the custom layout. Note: styling properties are omitted for clarity.

Below you can see an image of the produced custom layout, where the buttons, the thumbnails and the label are repositioned.
