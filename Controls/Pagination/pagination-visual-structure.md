Description

Thumbnails

Visual elements representing the number of items to page through. By default, thumbnails are displayed as small rectangles but you can specify a
							  template for them and make them actual previews of the paged items. The RadPagination in the image above uses such template. 
							  Clicking a thumbnail navigates the pagination (and the paged 
							  control) to the index this thumbnail corresponds to.
						  

Buttons

Could also be referred to as *"navigation buttons"*. Used to navigate the pagination (and the paged control)
							  back and forth.
						  

Label

Could also be referred to as *"page index label"*. By default, a label displays the current page index and the total
							  number of pages in the format [page index]/[total number of pages].
