# Architecture

Radial menus are an innovative type of toolbars providing the end-user with variety of options to choose from. Radial Menus are especially useful on touch devices
					as they enable the developers to place many commands and options in a flexible and dynamic UI container. The end-users enjoy interacting with a flexible and
					responsive UI at their fingertips. Radial menus enable the end-users to choose among hierarchically grouped commands and options in a convenient way where
					the user does not have stretch their fingers across the entire screen of the mobile device but rather across a designated area.
