* 

Focus the control: __TAB__ key when the control is next in the tab order. 
            

When the control is focused, the first element that is focused is the slider drag handle. If the control is a 
              __RadRangeSlider__, then the left/min drag handle is focused.
            

* 

Increment the value by the __smallStep__ property value: 
              __right arrow__ or __up arrow__.
            

* 

Decrement the value by the __smallStep__ property value: 
              __left arrow__ or __down arrow__.
            

* 

Increment the value by the __largeStep__ property value: __Page Up__ key.
            

* 

Decrement the value by the __largeStep__ property value: __Page Down__ key.
            

* 

Move the drag handle to the min value: __Home__ key.
            

* 

Move the drag handle to the max value: __End__ key.
            

* 

Tab to next slider drag handle when using __RadRangeSlider__: __TAB__ key.
            

* 

Tab to previous slider drag handle when using __RadRangeSlider__: 
              __Shift + TAB__ key.
            

The __TAB__ and __Shift + TAB__ keys can also navigate away of the control to the 
          next/previous control in the tab order.
