# Architecture

A slider component is used to allow the user to select a single value or a range of values from a predefined continuous set.
        

A slider usually has a track, ticks, and one or two value indicators. Optionally, you can add increase/decrease buttons or a tooltip
          to show the current value. All of these elements can be separately configured to customize the slider appearance.
        

Additionally, sliders can be vertically or horizontally oriented, its ranges can be limited, etc.
