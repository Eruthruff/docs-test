RadSparkline allows you to display simple, word-sized graphics that can be embedded in text, tables or headlines in a Windows Store 
        JavaScript application. Below is an example of how you can embed the RadSparkline control in a RadGrid to form informative data 
        tables.

# Architecture

[Edward Tufte defines sparklines](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR) as "small intense, simple, word-sized graphic with typographic resolution. Sparklines mean that graphics are no longer
					cartoonish special occasions with captions and boxes, but rather sparkline graphic can be everywhere a word or number can be: embedded in a sentence, table,
					headline, map, spreadsheet, graphic".
				

# RadSparkLine

RadSparkline is a version of the RadChart control tailored for the application described above.

While sparklines are typically line charts, RadSparkLine supports a [variety of types](8e4f0027-b713-4e91-b800-3d91c033ba31):
				

* 

Line

* 

Bar

* 

Column

* 

Area

* 

Pie

* 

Bullet

To enhance the data visualization provided by the sparklines, RadSparkline also features [tooltips](),
					[plot bands](372eef6e-38f4-491d-9e88-d7beb4296e25) and the concept of [axes](56dcbe2b-1d36-4355-88b8-b5e28b9aa778).
