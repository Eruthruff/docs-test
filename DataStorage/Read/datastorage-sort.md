# sort

To get a sorted data set from a table, use the __sort(propertyName, direction)__ method. The method receives two arguments:
				

* 

__propertyName__: The name of the field (table column) that you want to sort by.
						

* 

__direction__: The sort order â€“ *"asc"* for ascending or *"desc"*
							for descending.
						

To apply the sort expression, call the __execute()__ method.
				

The following example shows how to apply a single sort expression to the data retrieved from a Sales table in a SalesDB database.


 __js__
    


							db.get("Sales")
								.sort("name", "asc")
								.execute().then(querySuccess);



The above example will produce the same result as calling the __query__ method with the following SQL expression:
				

	
					SELECT * FROM Sales ORDER BY name ASC
				



To apply multiple sort expressions, use the __sort(propertyName, direction)__ method multiple times. At the end, call the
					__execute()__ method to trigger the chain of sort expressions.
				

This example shows how to apply multiple sort expressions.


 __js__
    


							db.get("Sales")
								.sort("salesQuota", "desc")
								.sort("name", "asc")
								.execute().then(querySuccess);



The above logic is equivalent to the following SQL expression:

	
					SELECT * FROM Sales ORDER BY salesQuota DESC, name ASC
