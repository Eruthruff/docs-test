Before you start using RadControls for Windows 8 / HTML, you must make sure that they are installed
				correctly on the development machine and that your Visual Studio project is using one of the JavaScript
				Windows Store templates. Once you have setup a JavaScript project in Visual Studio 2012 and added a reference
				to the RadControls for Windows 8 HTML SDK, you can open your project with Blend.
			

# BlendSectionUsing Blend with RadControls for Windows 8

Here is what you can do with the RadControls for Windows 8 HTML when you open a project in Blend:

* 

To add a new control to your page, open the assets tab in Blend, and then expand the References node. You should see
							all RadControls now. Drag and drop the control on the design surface to add it to the page. If you do not see RadControls in the
							References node, make sure that you have setup the project references correctly in Visual Studio 2012.
						

* 

To select a control, click on it in the design surface or navigate to its element in the live DOM window or the HTML window.
							After you have selected a control, you will be able to change its properties in the HTML attributes tab under Windows App Controls.
