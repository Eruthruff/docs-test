The easiest way to get RadControls for Windows 8 HTML on your machine is through an automatic installation. There are two ways to
				perform it - from the common installer (either Telerik Trial Installer or Telerik Control Panel) or using the MSI installer. This
				article will describe each of these options.
			

# Telerik Control Panel

To perform a few-step automatic installation/update of RadControls for Windows 8/HTML, you can download the[Telerik Control Panel](http://blogs.telerik.com/chriseargle/posts/12-07-16/introducing-the-telerik-control-panel.aspx).
					It allows you to install and update every product from the DevCraft suite with just a few clicks. The download is available in [
							your account's home page
						](http://www.telerik.com/account/). When you run the downloaded file, you will be able to pick the desired products for install:

Note that in order to get the Telerik Controls Examples project together with your installation, you need to check the
					__Local Demos__ checkbox upon installation:

# Telerik Trial Installer

Even with a trial license, you can get a common trial installer - Telerik Trial Installer - which will be the default download when you first want to
					[try out the suite's trial version](http://www.telerik.com/products/windows-8/download.aspx). Similar to the Telerik Control Panel, the Telerik Trial Installer allows you to install multiple products, so you should make sure
					you choose the Windows 8 product:

Remember, the Telerik Controls Examples installation is optional, so you need to click the checkbox for Local Demos during installation if you want to
					browse the quick start examples.
