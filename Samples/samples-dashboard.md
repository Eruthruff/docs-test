The __Telerik Dashboard__ sample app shows you how to use RadControls for Windows 8 Charts and Gauges in a real use-case scenario to bring
				data to end-users in an appealing and meaningful way.
			

The application visualizes statistic data about various economic factors in a number of countries and allows comparison between these
				countries' values. Included are various RadControls, serving two main purposesâ€”visualizing data and filtering the parameters for the displayed statistics.
