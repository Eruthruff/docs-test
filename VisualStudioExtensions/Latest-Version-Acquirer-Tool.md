The Latest Version Acquirer tool retrieves the freshest RadControls for Windows 8 HTML distribution,
					available on the Telerik website.
				

Clicking the Download button of the [Project Configuration Wizard](5a738803-b8c4-405c-aceb-4ddf281ba378) starts the Latest 
					Version Acquirer tool,
					prompting for your Telerik credentials and the type of license you own in its first page.
					If you do not have a
					[Telerik account](http://www.telerik.com/account/)
					, you can create one through the Register link.

You can check the additional information about the release by clicking the Release Notes link.
					This will open your default browser and navigate to a page with the release notes related to the specific version.
				

You can use the __Save my password__ checkbox to save having to enter your Telerik credentials multiple times.
					The persistence is done in a secure manner and credentials are saved in a per-user context. This way other users on your machine
					do not have access to your user data.
				

If your subscription has expired, you could either proceed with downloading a trial distribution or you
					could renew it and initiate the download again.
