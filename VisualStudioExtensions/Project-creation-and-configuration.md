				![new project wizard](../Media/VisualStudioExtensions\new_project_wizard.png)

The Project Configuration Wizard lets you define settings related to RadControls for Windows 8 HTML:
				

* 

__Telerik Extension SDKs__ - Select the RadControls distribution to be used. You can choose from the detected
							extension SDKs (from an installation folder), or you can browse to an extension SDK located somewhere on your hard drive
							(e.g. when you've downloaded a zip file from the [Latest Internal Builds](http://www.telerik.com/account/your-products/internal-builds.aspx) page).
						

* 

__Theme selection__ - Choose the theme to be applied to the project.
