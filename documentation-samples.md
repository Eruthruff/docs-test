The sample code in the RadControls for Windows 8 HTML documentation is based on and taken from actual running projects, to make sure that all examples we provide are
runnable and implement the described/shown functionality. Since we already have these examples, and in certain environments or in scenarios including multiple files
(images, XML files, etc.) running a sample is not just a matter of copy and paste, we decided to make these projects available for download.
			

You can find the solution containing projects for all UI controls in the products page in your account. Following is a description of how to locate and run a certain
				sample from the documentation.
			

# Running a sample from the documentation

To run a sample do the following:

* 

Go to your account and locate __DocumentationSamples.zip__ in the downloads list for the
							__RadControls for Windows 8__ product. You can see how to navigate to
							this list in point 2. of [this article](30abc202-5126-4395-bb0b-cd0108bdabfc). Download and unzip the file.
						

* 

Run the solution and expand the project of your interest.
						

* 

Check the __References__ section. If the reference to
							*RadControls for Windows 8 HTML* is broken, replace it with a working one. To be sure that all examples run correctly,
							it is best to use the latest official version of the controls.
						

* 

At the bottom of the article which examples you want to browse, you will find the location of the sample in the project. Copy this location and
							paste it in __package.appxmanifest__ under the __Start page__ field.
						

* 

Run the project.

Now you will see all examples from the help article in question. Each is placed under a heading corresponding to the section in the article where it is
					shown.
