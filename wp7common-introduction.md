Thank you for choosing Telerik __RadControls for Windows Phone__!

__RadControls for Windows Phone__ are built from the ground up for the Windows Phone 7 Operating System to deliver new user experience based on content and motion.
    The suite offers controls and capabilities that are currently not available in the UI Toolbox for Windows Phone 7 and not even in the OS. Combining Telerikâ€™s expertise in
    Silverlight development and the capabilities of the Windows Phone platform, __RadControls for Windows Phone__ are super light and blazing-fast controls for building
    mobile applications.
